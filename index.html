    <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
    <p>
      Hello ______________,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a Software Engineer with expertise in building secure and scalable enterprise systems. With over 5
      years of experience as a developer, I have worked with various languages during this period including; PHP,
      Java, C# and in recent times specializing on JavaScript and Golang.
      I've worked in very diverse teams of different sizes during this rollercoaster 5 year ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy building products that people love and derive a lot of fun working on open source tools.
      You might consider me a Full-Stack Engineer and in truth I am able to work on the frontend (I can't design
      though), or backend, or on some random utility library, even Desktop applications (if they still make
      those).
      I've very recently been doing DevOps "things" and I find that quite enjoyable. You'd find me writing on <a
        href="https://medium.com/@hyper_debugger" class="card__link">Medium</a> sometimes and here's a <a
        class="card__link" href="https://medium.com/@hyper_debugger">link</a> if you are interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      I absolutely love playing FIFA, you can reach out to setup a match!

          Worked with a team to deliver a highly scalable and configurable multi-tenant solution for the company's
          school
          manager service. This product (Dynamo) was developed to enable simple setup of very similar-looking
          applications
          and to enable code reuse and customizations through configurations by the clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dynamo directly improved the company's school manager offering and is, in fact, being used by about 5 schools
          being serviced by the company with around 20,000 students across. Collaborated to work on the back-end of
          various
          internal products being used by the company including functional libraries being used by the development team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Led the automation of DevOps practices in the company through the introduction of CI/ CD, proper code
          versioning, etc which reduced development time and infrastructure downtime. Mentored various members of the
          team
          and frequently
          held pair programming sessions with the team.

      I started out I believe, with PHP sometime when I was in the university. I wrote a bit of procedural PHP
      and then delved into Object-oriented programming with Java after that. I explored C++ and JavaScript also while I
      was in school. Internship in 2016
      helped me become better at writing Java and I also got introduced to Spring Boot and AngularJS as those were the
      frameworks of choice at the company.
      It was also a time of intense exploration as I worked my way around so many programming languages including
      Python, R, Scala, Kotlin, C, Ruby, etc. I think
      that helped me with my understanding of programming languages. I did a bit of C# and ASP.NET MVC at some point as
      well. Since then I have specialized in JavaScript and Golang.
