    <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
    <p>
      Hello ______________,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a Software Engineer with expertise in building secure and scalable enterprise systems. With over 5
      years of experience as a developer, I have worked with various languages during this period including; PHP,
      Java, C# and in recent times specializing on JavaScript and Golang.
      I've worked in very diverse teams of different sizes during this rollercoaster 5 year ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy building products that people love and derive a lot of fun working on open source tools.
      You might consider me a Full-Stack Engineer and in truth I am able to work on the frontend (I can't design
      though), or backend, or on some random utility library, even Desktop applications (if they still make
      those).
      I've very recently been doing DevOps "things" and I find that quite enjoyable. You'd find me writing on <a
        href="https://medium.com/@hyper_debugger" class="card__link">Medium</a> sometimes and here's a <a
        class="card__link" href="https://medium.com/@hyper_debugger">link</a> if you are interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      I absolutely love playing FIFA, you can reach out to setup a match!
