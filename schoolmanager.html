    <h2>Multi-tenant School Management Portal</h2>
    <p>
      This is an application that was built with <a class="card__link" href="/portfolio/dynamo">Dynamo</a>. It is a management portal for tertiary
      institutions and was built to be a Multi-tenant SaaS platform.
      This makes setting up of schools as easy creating the clients for the schools and issuing their client IDs.</p>
    <p>
      I led the team driving the deployment of various schools built using the Dynamo framework. Listed below are some
      of the schools running on Dynamo:
    <ul>
      <li><a class="card__link" href="http://application.futo.edu.ng/">Federal University of Technology, Owerri</a></li>
      <li><a class="card__link" href="https://portal.espoly.edu.ng/">Enugu State Polytechnic, Iwollo</a></li>
      <li><a class="card__link" href="https://portal.akwaibomstatecoe.com/">College of Education, Akwa Ibom</a></li>
      <li><a class="card__link" href="http://degreeportal.fceehaamufu.com/">Federal College of Education, Eha Amufu</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What did I do, you ask?</h3>
    <p>
      I primarily with React and the Dynamo framework during this period and was heavily involved in various sections of
      the product including the back-end and the front-end.
